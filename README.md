# cse-notsosocialnetwork
Project for CSE-337

If you are going to work on this project, the `master` now contains the running code for website. Please `branch` off of master and do your work there, and submit a pull request for your work so there can be some peer review to discern any issues that may exist in the new code. I'll be adding more description for folder structure and design scheme on the Python side of this project. Work needs to be completed on the following:

* SQL Database (*MariaDB*)
* Bottle/Python backend
* Profile / Homepage for Users

**The `gh-pages` webpage branch is accessable now at http://nssn.carrio.me**

Go ahead and clone the repo, checkout the branch, and start working on something other than the `index.html` landing page. 

The results of the survey are back, and leading majority on the following is out:

|Category|Result|Percentage (+gap)|
|:-------|:-----|:---------|
|Web Design IDE|Adobe Brackets|100%|
|Web Development IDE|IntelliJ IDEA|100%|
|Database|MariaDB|50% (+25%)|
|Client-Side Frameworks|Bootstrap|50% (+25%)|
||Ember/JQuery|25%(tied)|
|Server-Side Language|Python|75% (+50%)|
|Server Framework|Bottle|50% (+25%)|

As it stands, we still need to decide on a front-end JS framework, however all other decisions have been made. You can make an appeal on these in class if you have any disagreements.
